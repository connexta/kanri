### Admin UI for DDF

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/185de625-2a2a-42c6-925d-e6896f1238d2/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/modest-kirch-4025c1/deploys)

[Latest Build](https://modest-kirch-4025c1.netlify.app/)

A "Ship of Theseus" replacement for the existing DDF Admin UI. Backbone / Marionette (jquery, etc) dependencies have all been removed.

For now it's a replica, but we can start to build new areas and diverge. It also supports extensions for downstream DDFs to hook into, allowing them to customize their Admin UI.
